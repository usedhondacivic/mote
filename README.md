A low cost, high confidence mobile robot optimized for education.

Mote addresses the budget and reliability requirements of classroom learning through robust design and high confidence tooling.  
By mitigating the cost and frustration associated with real world robotics, Mote hopes to lower the barrier of entry for research level robotics. 

Mote is the spiritual successor of my master's thesis, [the Little Red Rover project](https://github.com/little-red-rover).
