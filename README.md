# Mote

A low cost, high confidence mobile robot optimized for education.

Mote addresses the budget and reliability constraints of classroom learning through robust design and high confidence tooling.  
By mitigating the cost and frustration of owning robotic hardware, Mote hopes to lower the barrier of entry to research level robotics.

Mote is the spiritual successor of my master's thesis, [the Little Red Rover project](https://github.com/little-red-rover).
